Small (unfortunately not in file size) and fast app to publish a message to a Google Cloud Pub/Sub topic.

The app is developed in Go and faster than the original Google Cloud CLI tool `gcloud`.
There are ready-to-run compiled binaries for Linux, macOS and Windows.

## üöÄ Benchmark

I developed this app because I wanted to publish messages faster to a Pub/Sub topic from a Raspberry Pi 4
(Broadcom BCM2711, Quad core Cortex-A72 (ARM v8) 64-bit SoC @ 1.5GHz) with Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit).

Here you have the comparison of the runtime to publish one message:

| This app  |          | Google Cloud CLI |
|-----------|----------|------------------|
| 0.293 sec | +1.9 sec | 2.193 sec        |

**This app**

```shell
pi@raspberry:~ $ time ./pubsub-publish -project="PROJECT_ID" -topic="TOPIC" -message='{"test":"true"}'

real    0m0.293s
user    0m0.241s
sys     0m0.058s
```

**Google Cloud CLI**

```shell
pi@raspberry:~ $ time gcloud pubsub topics publish "TOPIC" --project="PROJECT_ID" --message='{"test":"true"}'

real    0m2.193s
user    0m1.818s
sys     0m0.256s

pi@raspberry:~ $ time gcloud version
Google Cloud SDK 401.0.0
bq 2.0.75
core 2022.09.03
gcloud-crc32c 1.0.0
gsutil 5.12

real    0m1.961s
user    0m1.722s
sys     0m0.223s
```

You can see that it is not the publication of the actual message which takes a long time,
it is the launching of the Google Cloud CLI.
